# San Diego Notes

## Intoduction

I'm mostly going to be pointing out things in San Diego's North County. I'm more familiar with that area. It has a lot of things to like. It's generally super chill, it has a ton of good beaches and great nature areas.

## Restaurants

### [Punjabi Tandor](https://www.yelp.com/biz/punjabi-tandoor-san-diego)

Good Indian food, hole in the wall.

### [Regents Pizzeria](https://www.yelp.com/biz/regents-pizzeria-san-diego-2)

Super good Chicago style pizza.

## Cafes

### [Pannakin's coffee and tea in la Jolla](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pannikin-coffee-and-tea-la-jolla)

Cool place with a nice outdoors area in the upscale part of la Jolla. 

### [Bird Rock Coffee Roasters](https://www.yelp.com/biz/bird-rock-coffee-roasters-la-jolla)

Cafe within walking distance of a good beach. Cool seating area. Good coffee.

## Outdoor Things

### [Torrey Pines Gliderport](https://goo.gl/maps/EbXDqLypqTt)

little cafe with an amazing view of la Jolla cove. My favorite chilling spot in San Diego. On a nice day, there are a bunch of paragliders flying around here. You can do a Ride along for a fee. Only bathrooms are porta potties.

### [Torrey Pines State Reserve](https://goo.gl/maps/UmmZFw1qoN42)

Good hiking, lots of the hikes take you to some secluded beaches.

### [Carrillo National Monument](https://goo.gl/maps/TDHCj9XZpS42)

Cool hiking, some historical stuff. Really awesome tidepools if you head there at lowish tide.

### [Balboa Park](https://goo.gl/maps/uGaLsoBoZQo)

Huge urban park. Lots of gardens, museums, has the San Diego zoo. You can easily spend a whole day here. 

### [San Diego Zoo](https://goo.gl/maps/KoiBxAn21YJ2)

Huge zoo in balboa park.

### [Dan Diego Zoo Safari Park](https://goo.gl/maps/6ueeGiT7Uy72)

Zoo with a lot of interactive exibits. Pretty far away from San Diego City Center. See the San Diego Zoo first and if you want to see more animals, this one is good too.

## Beaches

### [La Jolla Cove](https://goo.gl/maps/q5BabsYyRrk)

Ocean area with a bunch of activities. 

#### [Downtown La Jolla Side](https://goo.gl/maps/q5BabsYyRrk)

On the South-West shore, there are a sea lions on some rocks. They are fun to watch getting into/out of the ocean and generally being Sea Lions. Lots of up-scale restaurants and stores around this area. There is also a [cave](https://goo.gl/maps/bFJGRKHVRUM2) that you can go down into and get a unique view of the ocean. The snorkeling is pretty good on this side. You enter the water on a pretty crowded but isolated (from waves) beach. You can sometimes snorkel right next to a sea lion or seal.

#### [La Jolla Shores Side](https://goo.gl/maps/4xTsFcFPZnM2)

Good beach. Luis is familiar. It's a good place to get surf lessons [Surf Diva](https://goo.gl/maps/taE9etrUXcA2) if the surf is good, otherwise you can snorkel here and see a bunch of cool sea life. Generally, the area in front of the [Marine Room](https://goo.gl/maps/CHumuyqGMFq) is a good place for snorkeling. You can also venture a bit more to the South of the Marine room.

### [Del Mar Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/ASrfpsm6zX22)

Super nice beach. Some up scale shopping near by. Decent eating options around. 

### [Coronado Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/9mwoRJ6UWrR2)

Nice beach, good place to walk around lots of touristy things around the island.
